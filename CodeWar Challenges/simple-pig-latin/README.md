# Simple Pig Latin

Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Don't worry about punctuation for today.

Examples:

```js
pig_it('Pig latin is cool') // igPay atinlay siay oolcay
pig_it('Hello world')     // elloHay orldWay !
```

This is a no resource assignment. You may only use these [cheatsheets](https://git.generalassemb.ly/hartcode/cheat-sheets), none of your previous code, no lesson plans, and no Google!

I will give you one hint, [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice) allows you to get a slice of a string.
