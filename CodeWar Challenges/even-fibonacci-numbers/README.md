# Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```
Input : limit = 8
Output : 10
Explanation : 2 + 8 = 10

Input : limit = 400;
Output : 188.
Explanation : 2 + 8 + 34 + 144 = 180.
```
